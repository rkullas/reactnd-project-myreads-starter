# MyReads Project

This repository is a exercise for the course React Fundamentals of Udacity's React Nanodegree. The Application has two pages. The root page shows a list of books grouped in shelfs and the second page has the function to search for new books. On each page you have the possibility to move a book to another shelf.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
